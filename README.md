# Sending emails with Python  
Script to send emails with Python.  

## How To Use  
#### Command Line Arguments to be given:
1. Email address that will receive the email.
2. Name of the recipient.
3. Email address that will send the email.
4. Password to match the sender email address.  

In the case that you are sending emails through __gmail__, you must turn [this setting](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) on.  
For more info visit this:  
- [Less Secured Apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255)
- [Third party sites & apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521)

I recommend turning the feature back __OFF__ once done using this script, since it is an extra security feature for your gmail account.
